# Physics Problem Solution: Ski Racer on a Slope

## Problem Statement
A starting gate acts horizontally to restrain a 62 kg ski racer on a frictionless 30 degree slope. What horizontal force does the starting gate apply to the skier?

## 1. Identifying Quantities and Forces

### Given Quantities:
- Mass of the skier (m) = 62 kg
- Angle of the slope (θ) = 30°
- Surface condition: Frictionless (μ = 0)

### Forces Acting on the Skier:
- **Weight (W = mg)**: Acting downward due to Earth's gravity
- **Normal force (N)**: Perpendicular to the slope surface
- **Horizontal restraining force (F)**: Applied by the starting gate (this is what we need to find)

## 2. Physical Significance

- The **weight** pulls the skier downward with a magnitude of mg = 62 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 607.6 N
- The **normal force** prevents the skier from sinking into the slope
- The slope is **frictionless**, so there's no force resisting motion parallel to the slope
- The **horizontal restraining force** from the gate prevents the skier from sliding down the slope

## 4. Finding Relevant Equations

Since the skier is at rest, the net force must be zero in all directions:

1. In the x-direction (parallel to the horizontal): 
   - F - W·sin(θ) = 0
   - F = W·sin(θ)
   - F = mg·sin(θ)

2. In the y-direction (perpendicular to the horizontal):
   - N - W·cos(θ) = 0
   - N = W·cos(θ)
   - N = mg·cos(θ)

## 5. SymPy Solution

```python
import sympy as sp
import numpy as np

# Define symbols
m = 62  # kg
g = 9.8  # m/s²
theta = np.radians(30)  # Convert to radians

# Calculate the weight
W = m * g

# Calculate the component of weight parallel to the slope
W_parallel = W * np.sin(theta)

# The horizontal force must equal this component to keep the skier stationary
F = W_parallel

# Calculate the normal force (not needed for the answer, but included for completeness)
N = W * np.cos(theta)

print(f"The horizontal force applied by the starting gate is {F:.2f} N")
```

## 6. Solution

The horizontal force applied by the starting gate is 303.8 N.

This force counteracts the component of the skier's weight that's trying to pull them down the slope. Since the slope is at 30°, the weight component parallel to the slope is mg·sin(30°), and this is what the horizontal force must counter to keep the skier stationary.
